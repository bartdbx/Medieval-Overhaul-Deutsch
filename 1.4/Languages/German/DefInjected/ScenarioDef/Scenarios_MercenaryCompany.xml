    <DankPyon_MercenaryStart.description>Mein Lord, to whom you and your comrades remained forever loyal as long as there is money, fell at a concise battle. Free of your oath, your band of mercenaries departed to neighboring towns and cities in search of opportunity for silver and reputation but were disappointed to find peace-laden settlements, full of bounties fit for a daytaler. Eager to begin anew, you and your comrades settle land in the wilderness in hopes to one day grow wealth and return to former glory.</DankPyon_MercenaryStart.description>
