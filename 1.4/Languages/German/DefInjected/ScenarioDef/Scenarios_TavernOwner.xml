    <DankPyon_TavernOwnerStart.description>The walls of a city were never reassuring. Neither was the bustle of urban life that could suck the soul out of a lich, given time. What opportunities you could find were unsuitable for you for so many, many reasons: one, a lack of fitness, while another a lack of heartlessness.

      It was this environment that told you to leave, with but raw materials and simple tools to fashion your dream. For you aspired to a home out in the wilderness, a hearth that could welcome many a weary and worn traveler. Rogue or hero, it would shelter them all.
      
      With any hope comes risk, and this was one you could not ignore. Reports from the local garrison indicated an increased bandit presence, and crime was on the rise. Even with the most careful preparations, a criminal would most likely follow your trail.
      
      But you took the leap of faith, and stepped across the threshold of the city. With wilderness ahead and treachery behind, you march away.
      
      Optimism and worry cloud your brow.</DankPyon_TavernOwnerStart.description>
